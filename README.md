## Installation from GitHub üõ†Ô∏è

Ready to use **Magic Merge**? Here‚Äôs how to get it running on your system in just a few steps:

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repo
You can either clone the repository or download it directly from GitHub:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you're familiar with Git):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alaynavendetta/MagicMerge.git
   ```
   
2. **Download the ZIP file**:  
   Head to the [Magic Merge GitHub page](https://github.com/alaynavendetta/MagicMerge), click the **"Code"** button, and select **"Download ZIP"**. Then, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Before you can run **Magic Merge**, you'll need to install a few Python libraries. To make things easier, we've provided a **`requirements.txt`** file, which contains all the dependencies you'll need.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you've cloned or downloaded **Magic Merge**.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will ensure that **Magic Merge** has everything it needs to run smoothly! üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 3: Run the App
Once the dependencies are installed, you‚Äôre all set! To start **Magic Merge**, simply run the following command in your terminal (while in the **Magic Merge** directory):

```bash
python magicmerge.py
```

The executable files for Mac and Windows will be posted under releases for ease of install. All the required dependencies in the requirements.txt (you know, all two of them) will be packed in the .exe file. With that version it is basically plug and play, without having to tinker with python. This version here is for those who already have python and don't want or don't require things being packed in one easy to use format. If you don't already have or want python *this is not the version for you.*
